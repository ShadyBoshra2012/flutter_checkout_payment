## Explain

This plugin is for [Checkout](https://checkout.com) online payment. It's implemented the native SDKs to work on Flutter environment.

## Getting Started

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_checkout_payment: ^1.4.0
```

### Android

No additional work required

### iOS

The SDK build for >= iOS 10.0, so you need to set the platform version in the `Podfile` to iOS 10 or above.

```
platform: :ios, '10.0'
```


## Usage

You just have to import the package with

```dart
import 'package:flutter_checkout_payment/flutter_checkout_payment.dart';
```

Then, you need to initialize the API with you public key. Your public key is found on Checkout dashboard.

```dart
await FlutterCheckoutPayment.init(key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
```

And when you are ready for production you have to set the environment to Live.

```dart
await FlutterCheckoutPayment.init(key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", environment: Environment.LIVE);
```

Now, you can generate the Token which you will use to proceed the payment.

```dart
CardTokenisationResponse response = await FlutterCheckoutPayment.generateToken(number: "4242424242424242", name: "name", expiryMonth: "05", expiryYear: "21", cvv: "100");
print(response.token);
```

## Apple Pay
If you are using the official flutter [pay package](https://pub.dev/packages/pay) to handle apple pay, you must send your apple token as the following:

    final paymentDataBase64 = jsonDecode(applePayPaymentData['token']);
    String jsonString = jsonEncode(paymentDataBase64);
    List<int> bytes = utf8.encode(jsonString);
    String base64String = base64Encode(bytes);
    final token = await FlutterCheckoutPayment.generateApplePayToken(paymentDataBase64: base64String);
